# ECG-Filter-Design
In this Codes, my main task was to design efficient digital filters to eliminate all the noise sources associated with the ECG signal so as to get a noise free ECG signal as output from the filters.

ECG inevitably affected by various types of noise interference such as:

1. Baseline Wander noise
2. Power Line Interference (50/60 HZ)

A 4th order Elliptic filter and a 4th order Chebyshev Type II configurations are found to be better choice for the implementation of high pass and Notch filters respectively.
